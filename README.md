# Tetris of the Colossus

You are but a fragment, fallen from the Tetris Motherboard.  Come find your source...

Hi everyone !

Here is our unlikely combination of TETRIS and SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS for Ludum Dare 41.

Like Tetris, you build blocks (but this time in 3D !)

Like Shadow of the Colossus, you need to find the Colossus weak spot.

- SIMPLE MODE (or FREE PLAY in the game menu):
Open play of the level, without timer on the block drop. You might want to start with this.

- HARDCORE MODE (or NORMAL GAME in the game menu):
For those of us who are into a challenge! This mode has a timer on the blocks and comes closer to original Tetris gameplay

## Controls:
- Mouse to look around and choose a direction
- Left click to go forward
- Right click to confirm block position

## Builds:
Builds for Linux, Windows or Mac are on [Itch.io](https://elmeri.itch.io/tetris-of-the-colossus)

## Instructions

To rebuild the game, just create a new unity project, and replace the sources. Build it and enjoy!
For the music, it was meant to be played by Wwise with an (over ambitious for game jam) interactive music, so you have to make it play by yourself.
